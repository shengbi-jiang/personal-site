# Welcome to my personal site!

Hi! My name is Alan Jiang, a software engineer.

The picture above was captured at the entry of Songshan Feng Tian Temple in 2021, which is located in Taipei, Taiwan. It is the largest Taoist temple in the north of Taiwan. I often visit the temple to worship gods and appreciate its traditional culture. Taoism tells everything has Yin and Yang aspects, like shadow cannot exist without light. Sometimes, one of them may stand-outs over the other because of context or one's bias, which could blind people to the existence and importance of the other aspect. In the world of software engineering, there are many different principles, methodologies, and tools. Some may strictly follow or use some of them due to personal favor or team's preference in a company, which could lead people to overlook the upsides of the others or even deviate from the correct path. The philosophy of Yin and Yang from Taoism reminds me about the duality of everything and to be open for different mindsets and their every aspect as much as possible.
